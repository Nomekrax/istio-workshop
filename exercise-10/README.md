## Exercise 10 - Request Routing and Canary Testing

### Inspecting Mixer

Envoy proxies call Mixer to report statistics and check for route rules. By opening up some of the mixer ports we can get an of idea what calls its seeing:

```sh
kubectl get pods -n istio-system
kubectl port-forward -n istio-system istio-mixer-... 9093:9093
curl localhost:9093/metrics
```

### Configure the default route for the Hello World service

Because there are 2 version of the HelloWorld Service Deployment (v1 and v2), before modifying any of the routes a default route needs to be set to just V1. Otherwise it will just round robin between V1 and V2

1. Set the default version for all requests to the hello world service.

```sh
istioctl create -f guestbook/route-rule-force-hello-v1.yaml
```

This ingress rule forces `v1` of the service by giving it a precedence of `1`. We can see this by describing the resource we created:
```sh
kubectl describe routerules helloworld-default

Name:         helloworld-default
Namespace:    default
Labels:       <none>
Annotations:  <none>
API Version:  config.istio.io/v1alpha2
Kind:         RouteRule
Metadata:
  ...
Spec:
  Destination:
    Name:      helloworld-service
  Precedence:  1
  Route:
    Labels:
      Version:  1.0
```

2. Now when you curl the echo service it should always return `v1` of the hello world service.

```sh
curl http://$INGRESS_IP/echo/universe  

{"greeting":{"hostname":"helloworld-service-v1-286408581-9204h","greeting":"Hello universe from helloworld-service-v1-286408581-9204h with 1.0","version":"1.0"},"
```
```sh
curl http://$INGRESS_IP/echo/universe

{"greeting":{"hostname":"helloworld-service-v1-286408581-9204h","greeting":"Hello universe from helloworld-service-v1-286408581-9204h with 1.0","version":"1.0"},"
```

### Canary Testing

Currently the routing rule only routes to `v1` of the hello world service which. What we want to do is a deployment of `v2` of the Hello World service by allowing only a small amount of traffic to it from a small group. This can be done by creating another rule with a higher precedence that routes some of the traffic to `v2`. We can do canary testing by splitting traffic between the 2 versions:

```yaml
  apiVersion: config.istio.io/v1alpha2
  kind: RouteRule
  metadata:
    name: route-rule-80-20
  spec:
    destination:
      name: helloworld-service
    precedence: 2
    route:
    - labels:
        version: "1.0"
      weight: 80
    - labels:
        version: "2.0"
      weight: 20
```

Note that rules with a higher precedence number are applied first. If a precedence is not specified, then it defaults to 0. So with these two rules in place, the one with precedence 2 will be applied before the rule with precedence 1.

You can apply this rule from an existing configuration:
```sh
istioctl create -f guestbook/route-rule-80-20.yaml
```

Then try a few calls to the service:
```sh
curl http://$INGRESS_IP/echo/universe

{"greeting":{"hostname":"helloworld-service-v1-286408581-9204h","greeting":"Hello universe from helloworld-service-v1-286408581-9204h with 1.0","version":"1.0"},"
```

Clean up
```sh
istioctl delete -f guestbook/route-rule-80-20.yaml
```

### Route based on HTTP header

We can also canary test based on HTTP headers: if the user-agent is "mobile" it'll go to `v2`, otherwise requests will go to `v1`. Written as a route rule, this looks like:

```yaml
destination:
  name: helloworld-service
match:
  request:
    headers:
      user-agent:
        exact: mobile
precedence: 2
route:
  - labels:
      version: "2.0"
```

Note that rules with a higher precedence number are applied first. If a precedence is not specified then it defaults to 0. So with these two rules in place the one with precedence 2 will be applied before the rule with precedence 1.

Test this out by creating the rule:
```sh
istioctl create -f guestbook/route-rule-user-mobile.yaml
```

Now when you curl the end point set the user agent to be mobile and you should only see V2:

```sh
curl http://$INGRESS_IP/echo/universe -A mobile

{"greeting":{"hostname":"helloworld-service-v2-3297856697-6m4bp","greeting":"Hello dog2 from helloworld-service-v2-3297856697-6m4bp with 2.0","version":"2.0"}
```

```sh
curl http://$INGRESS_IP/echo/universe

{"greeting":{"hostname":"helloworld-service-v1-286408581-9204h","greeting":"Hello universe from helloworld-service-v1-286408581-9204h with 1.0","version":"1.0"},"
```

An important point to note is that the user-agent http header is propagated in the span baggage. Look at these two classes for details on how the header is [injected](https://github.com/retroryan/istio-by-example-java/blob/master/spring-boot-example/spring-istio-support/src/main/java/com/example/istio/IstioHttpSpanInjector.java) and [extracted](https://github.com/retroryan/istio-by-example-java/blob/master/spring-boot-example/spring-istio-support/src/main/java/com/example/istio/IstioHttpSpanExtractor.java):

Clean up
```sh
istioctl delete -f guestbook/route-rule-user-mobile.yaml
```
### Route based on the browser

It is also possible to route it based on the Web Browser. For example the following routes to version 2.0 if the browser is chrome:

```yaml
match:
  request:
    headers:
      user-agent:
        regex: ".*Chrome.*"
route:
- labels:
    version: "2.0"
```

To apply this route run:

```sh
istioctl create -f guestbook/route-rule-user-agent-chrome.yaml
```

Test this by first navigating to the echo service in Chrome:

http://INGRESS_IP/echo/universe

You should see:

```
Hola test from helloworld-service-v2-87744028-x20j0 version 2.0
```

If you then navigate to it another browser like Firefox you will see:

```
Hello sdsdffsd from helloworld-service-v1-4086392344-42q21 with 1.0
```

Clean up
```sh
istioctl delete -f guestbook/route-rule-user-agent-chrome.yaml
```
